Made a Flow Chart before started making the skeleton file during Lab session (5-13-25). 
Original plan: Use BFS with queue.

AI Usage (CoPilot and ChatGPT)
 - Which is better for keeping track of files, DFS or BFS? 
        - DFS will be used in the program.
 - Is it better to use a stack for the program or is there a way to backtrack?
        - Use of recursion for backtracking with proper topological sort algorithm. Simpler, less code.
        - With stack, more code and more complex
